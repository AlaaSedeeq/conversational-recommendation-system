The previews for The Ladykillers made it look like a charming, Southern US, caper film. Sure enough, there were plenty of grey-haired folks in the theatre. I can\\'t imagine they expected the constant MF swearing from one of the characters. This is a remake of the 1955 hit UK film of the same name starring Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness. The new version relies on repetitive gag humor and the clash between a conservative Christian woman and a foul-mouthed, \"hippity-hop\" criminal, to get most of its laughs. Some of the other supporting cast members are nothing but dumb cliches (big, dumb jock, quiet, sly Communist Chinese General, etc.) Tom Hanks plays the role of ring leader as if he were a cartoon character. There\\'s really no intrigue or really good humor in this obvious Cohen Brothers sellout. Not a must-see film.\\n\\nUser: Hmm, I see. Can you recommend me something else?\\n\\nAgent: Sure! I recommend you to watch Scoop. This will bring to mind several other Allen films like Manhattan Murder Mystery, Curse Of the Jade Scorpion, and Broadway Danny Rose. This movie is really a fun experience for the viewer. Scarlett Johansen is great in it, as is Hugh Jackman. The script is witty and the action moves briskly along with beautiful shots of London as a bonus.
